## My process

### Built with

- Basic HTML
- Basic CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm currently familiarizing myself with the basics. Right now, it feels a bit uncomfortable building things and striving for perfection. Instead of worrying about perfecting the design, I'm focusing on becoming comfortable with using the technology.

### Continued development

I'll keep building beginner projects until I feel comfortable, gradually increasing the difficulty over time. I know my current project isn't perfect, but I'll continue to improve it. With time, it will become great and visually appealing.
